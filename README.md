# Graphyte

_Graphyte_ is a JavaScript based graph visualization library built with emphasis on customization and modularity. These design decisions led to a core framework responsible for interconnecting pluggable modules. Following that spirit, _Graphyte_ doesn’t offer ready-made visualizations like e.g. HighCharts or NVD3 which offer out-of-the-box solutions for standard charts. Instead, the intended audience of _Graphyte_ are developers who are looking for a solid library to create heavily customized graph visualizations. 

## Installation

```bash
npm install graphyte
cd graphyte
npm install
```

## Examples

To run the examples in your browser:

```bash
cd graphyte
npm install --only=dev
npm start
```
